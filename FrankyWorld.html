          Robots have come a long way since our first clumsy forays into artificial movement many decades
          ago. Today, companies such as Boston Dynamics produce ultra-efficient robots which load trucks, build pallets, and
          move boxes around factories, undertaking tasks you might think only humans could perform.

          <p>
            Despite these advances, designing robots to work in unknown or inhospitable environments, like
    exoplanets or deep ocean trenches, still poses a considerable challenge for scientists and engineers. Out in the
    cosmos, what shape and size should the ideal robot be? Should it crawl or walk? What tools will it need to
    manipulate its environment, and how will it survive extremes of pressure, temperature and chemical corrosion?
          </p>
          <p>
            Any evolved robots will need to be capable of sensing their environment and have
            diverse means of moving—for example using wheels, jointed legs, or even mixtures of the two. And to address the
            inevitable reality gap that occurs when transferring a design from software to hardware, it is also desirable for at
            least some evolution to take place in hardware, within an ecosystem of robots that evolve in real time and real
            space.
